## Introduction

In every company's system, there are always some systems with complex business logic. These systems carry the core business logic, and almost every requirement is related to this core business. The core business logic is lengthy, involving internal logical operations, cache operations, persistence operations, external resource retrieval, internal system RPC calls, and so on. As time goes by, the project has changed hands several times, and the maintenance cost will become higher and higher. There are various hard-coded judgments and increasing branching conditions. The abstraction and reuse rate of the code are getting lower, and the coupling between modules is high. A small change in logic will affect other modules and require complete regression testing for verification. If you want to flexibly change the order of the business process, you need to make major code changes and rewrite methods. Real-time hot change of the business is almost impossible to achieve.

How can we solve this problem? LiteFlow is born to decouple logic, born to orchestrate. After using LiteFlow, you will find it easy to create a loosely coupled and flexible system!

LiteFlow is a very powerful modern rule engine framework that integrates the characteristics of orchestration and rule engine.

## Advantages of the LiteFlow framework

If you need to write or refactor complex business logic, LiteFlow is the most suitable choice. It is a rule engine framework for component orchestration, it helps decouple business code and treats each business segment as a component.

With LiteFlow, you can transform waterfall code into a code structure centered around components. The benefit of this structure is that it allows for flexible arrangement and decoupling between components. Components can be defined using scripts, and the flow between components is driven by rules. LiteFlow has a DSL syntax for a relatively simple open-source rule engine. It only takes ten minutes to get started.

The component can be hot-reloaded in real-time, or you can add a component to the logic flow in real-time to change your business logic.

The script component of LiteFlow supports many scripting languages and is fully integrated with Java. You can use scripts to implement any logic.

LiteFlow supports storing rules and scripts in databases and registration centers. It also provides interfaces for easy customization and unlimited expansion.

Our rule grammar is very powerful and can describe any logical flow you want. Have you ever thought about how to implement such a complex logical flow in ordinary code?

For example:

:::tip
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e8.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

Another example:

:::tip 
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e9.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

It is necessary to ensure that all components are flexible and adaptable.

I believe someone can definitely achieve it, but it will require a lot of development costs.



**The above process will become very simple with LiteFlow!**



## The design principles of LiteFlow

LiteFlow is designed based on the workbench mode. What does the workbench mode mean?

There are n workers who produce parts around a workbench in a certain order. These parts can be assembled into a machine. Each worker only needs to complete their own part and does not need to know what other workers are producing. Each worker takes the resources they need for production from the workbench. If the resource is not available on the workbench, they wait until it is available. The parts made by each worker are also placed on the workbench.

This mode has several advantages:

- Each worker does not need to communicate with other workers. Workers only need to focus on their own job and the resources on their workstations. This achieves decoupling between each worker.
- If workers switch positions, there will be no change in their job content and required resources. This ensures the stability of each worker.
- If a worker is assigned to another workbench, the worker's job content and required resources remain unchanged, This ensures the reusability of each worker.
- Because each worker does not need to communicate with other workers, they can perform real-time position substitution, insertion, and removal during the production tasks, so that the production tasks can be changed in real-time. This ensures the flexibility of the entire production tasks.

This mode is mapped to the LiteFlow framework, where "worker" refers to components, the order in which workers produce is the flow configuration, the workstation represents the context, and resources are the parameters. The assembled machine represents the result of this business. Because of this, LiteFlow provides decoupling and flexibility.



## Which scenarios are not suitable for LiteFlow?

Since the open source of LiteFlow, I have been frequently asked how LiteFlow handles the flow between role tasks, similar to an approval process where A approves and then it should be passed to B, and then passed to role C.

:::tip
LiteFlow only handles logic-based flow control, not role-based task flow control. If you want to implement role-based task flow control, I recommend using [flowable](https://flowable.com/open-source/)Ôºå[activiti](https://www.activiti.org/).

## What are the scenarios suitable for LiteFlow?

LiteFlow is suitable for businesses with complex logic, such as price engines and order processes. These businesses often have many steps that can be split into independent components for assembly. By using LiteFlow, you will obtain a highly flexible and scalable system, which can avoid the risk of making changes that affect the entire system.
