If you want to execute components a, b, c, and d in sequence, you can use the `THEN` keyword. Please note that `THEN` must be capitalized.

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(a, b, c, d);
</chain>
```

If you write it in a nested way, it is equals to the above:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(a, b, THEN(c, d));
</chain>
```
